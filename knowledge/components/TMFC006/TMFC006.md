# 2. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service<br>Catalog<br>Management | TMFC006 | The Service Catalog Management<br>component is responsible for organizing the<br>collection of service specifications that<br>identify and define all requirements of a<br>service that can be performed. This<br>component has the functionality that<br>enables presentation of a customer-facing<br>view so users are able to search and select<br>services they need, as well as a technical<br>view to enable definition and setup of what<br>is needed to deliver service specifications<br>(Customer Facing Service Specifications<br>(CFSSs) and Resource Facing Service<br>Specifications (RFSSs)) contained in the<br>service catalog. The Service Catalog<br>Management component has functionalities<br>that include creation of new service<br>specifications, managing service<br>specifications, administering the lifecycle of<br>services, describing relationships between<br>service specification attributes, reporting on<br>service specifications and their changes,<br>and facilitating easy and systematic<br>indexing and access to services, as well as<br>facilitating automation of the service<br>delivery process. | Production |

## 4.3. Events

The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from the APIs listed in the preceding sections.

![](media/events-structure.png)
*([PlantUML source](media/events-structure.puml))*

The type of event could be: • Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). • Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. • AttributeValueChange or Change: an attribute from the resource has changed - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • StateChange: resource state has changed.
