# 1. Overview

| Component Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product<br>Configurator | TMFC027 | The Product Configurator aims to provide<br>sales representatives and customers with<br>fast and error-free product qualification and<br>product configuration capabilities across all<br>channels.<br>It uses mostly the Product Catalog and the<br>Product Inventory information, and is able<br>to execute and check all types of Product<br>Catalog policy rules (e.g. packaging rules,<br>commercial pre-requisite rules, pricing<br>rules, consistency rules between<br>characteristic values). It can also use Party<br>related information, such as the age of the<br>customer, or specific contextual<br>information, such as the channel.<br>It can be triggered in contexts such as<br>product order capture, shopping cart or<br>quote management. It supports the Product<br>Order Capture and Validation component<br>(TMFC002) to:<br>• Establish commercial offering<br>eligibility, and to provide alternative<br>product offerings in case of<br>ineligible product offering selection<br>• Leads the configuration of selected<br>eligible product offerings according<br>to the context. Product configuration<br>includes computation of<br>characteristics values, allowed<br>values, bundled and related product<br>offering, pricing and discounts | Core Commerce<br>Management |

# 2. eTOM Processes, SID Data Entities and

Functional Framework Functions

## 2.1. eTOM business activities

eTOM business activities this ODA Component is responsible for:

| Identifier | Level | Business Activity Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2.5 | L2 | Product<br>Configuration<br>Management | Configuration Management configures or creates a<br>new version of a configuration for an entity, such as<br>a product,service or resource, as defined by a<br>configuration specification. This process also<br>modifies a configuration and values for configuration<br>parameters, and removes a configuration. |
| 1.2.5.2 | L3 | Manage Product<br>Configuration | Manage Product Configuration business activity is in<br>charge of creating, maintaining, controlling,<br>changing and reporting Product Configuration<br>according to Product Configuration Plans.<br>Manage Product Configuration will establish and<br>maintaining consistency of a product's performance,<br>functional, and physical attributes within the limits<br>defined by product requirements, product design,<br>and operational information throughout the Products<br>Lifecycle. |

## 2.2. SID ABEs

SID ABEs this ODA Component is responsible for:

| SID ABE Level 1 | SID ABE L1 Definition | SID ABE Level 2 (or set of BEs)* |   | SID ABE L2<br>Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product<br>Configurati<br>on | A Product Configuration (also referred to<br>as a Product Profile) defines how a<br>Product operates or functions.<br>A Product Configuration may contain one<br>or more parts, and each part may contain<br>zero or more fields. Each field may have<br>attributes that are statically or dynamically<br>defined. Some of these fields have fixed<br>values, while others provide values from<br>which a choice or choices can be made<br>(e.g. using the EntitySpec/Entity and/or<br>CharacteristicSpec/CharacteristicValue<br>patterns) 1 | ProductConfigurati<br>on | A<br>representati<br>on of how a<br>Product<br>operates or<br>functions in<br>terms of<br>characteristi<br>cs and<br>related<br>Product(s). |   |

1 As in GB922 Product v23.0 document the definition of the ABE Product Configuration is a copy of the Configuration ABE pattern defined in GB922 Common v23.0, it is here adapted to the product level only. *: if SID ABE Level 2 is not specified this means that all the L2 business entities must be implemented, else the L2 SID ABE Level is specified.

## 3.3. Events

The diagram illustrates the Events which the component publishes and the Events that the component subscribes to and then receives. Both lists are derived from the APIs listed in the preceding sections. The type of event could be: • Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). • Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. • AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • StateChange: resource state has changed.
