2. eTOM Processes, SID Data Entities and Functional Framework Functions

## 2.1. eTOM business activities

<Note to not be inserted onto ODA Component specifications: If a new ABE is required, but it does not yet exist in SID. Then you should include a textual description of the new ABE, and it should be clearly noted that this ABE does not yet exist. In addition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new ABE is added to SID, and the SID team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component without this ABE. If the ABE is critical then the component specification should not be published until the ABE issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the ABE is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.> eTOM business activities this ODA Component is responsible for.

## 2.2. SID ABEs

<Note not to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new ABE is required, but it does not yet exist in SID. Then you should include a textual description of the new ABE, and it should be clearly noted that this ABE does not yet exist. In addition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new ABE is added to SID, and the SID team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component without this ABE. If the ABE is critical then the component specification should not be published until the ABE issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the ABE is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.> SID ABEs this ODA Component is responsible for:

| SID ABE Level 1 | SID ABE Level 2 (or set of BEs)* |

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event. <Note note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In addition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>
