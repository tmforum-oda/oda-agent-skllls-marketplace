# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service<br>Qualification | TMFC009 | Service Qualification component is responsible<br>for checking and validating the availability of a<br>service according to specified and configured<br>business rules. It must identify at least one<br>technical solution (RFSspec) available to deliver<br>the service (CFSspec) and check the availability<br>of all the resources types involved in this<br>technical solution. No resources are allocated<br>during Service Qualification.<br>Service Qualification component has functionality<br>that include checking service feasibility status<br>and publishing or reporting service qualification<br>result, but also calculated service delivery due<br>date and identified need of an appointment at the<br>customer site.<br>Service Qualification can also be in charge of the<br>cost calculation of the technical solution<br>identified, when it cannot be determined at<br>catalog design time (complex B2B services). This<br>information will be used as an input to price<br>calculation. | Production |

# 2. eTOM Processes, SID Data Entities and

Functional Framework Functions

## 2.1. eTOM business activities

eTOM business activities this ODA Component is responsible for:

| Identifier | Level | Business Activity Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.4.5 | L2 | Service<br>Configuration<br>& Activation | Service Configuration & Activation processes<br>encompass allocation, implementation, configuration,<br>activation and testing of specific services to meet<br>customer requirements, or in response to requests<br>from other processes to alleviate specific service<br>capacity shortfalls, availability concerns or failure<br>conditions. Where included in the service provider<br>offering, these processes extend to cover customer<br>premises equipment.<br>Responsibilities of the Service Configuration &<br>Activation processes include, but are not limited to:<br>• Verifying whether specific service designs<br>sought by customers are feasible as part of pre-<br>order feasibility checks;<br>• Allocating the appropriate specific service<br>parameters to support service orders or requests<br>from other processes;<br>• Reserving specific service parameters (if required<br>by the business rules) for a given period of time until<br>the initiating customer order is confirmed, or until the<br>reservation period expires (if applicable);<br>• Implementing, configuring and activating specific<br>services, as appropriate;<br>• Testing the specific services to ensure the service is<br>working correctly;<br>• Recovery of specific services;<br>• Updating of the Service Inventory Database to<br>reflect that the specific service has been allocated,<br>modified or recovered;<br>• Assigning and tracking service provisioning<br>activities;<br>• Managing service provisioning jeopardy conditions<br>• Reporting progress on service orders to other<br>processes. |
| ? | ? | ? | no L3 to cover standard availability/feasibility<br>checks |

Note: refer to JIRA section and the need to identify a new Service Availability Check/Assessment activity at Service level, as part of L2 Service Configuration & Activation Note: previously identified processes at Resource level didn't exist anymore in eTOM 23.5 and no equivalent has been found. A new Jira ticket is created.

## 2.2. SID ABEs

SID ABEs this ODA Component is responsible for:

Note: refer to JIRA section and the need to create a Service Qualification BE.

## 2.3. eTOM L2 - SID ABEs links

## 2.4. Functional Framework Functions

Note: refer to JIRA section for improvement in classification and new function required.

| Function<br>ID | Function<br>Name | Function Description | Aggregate Functions Level 1 | Aggregate Functions Level 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 319 | Service<br>Feasibility<br>Checking | Service Feasibility Checking<br>provides checking based on the<br>customer service location, service<br>feasibility checks are done to<br>assure the offering can actually be<br>provided to the customer. This<br>implies that the customer location<br>is clearly established. Service<br>feasibility checks are conducted<br>via contract with the Service Order<br>Management function. | Service<br>Order<br>Management | Service<br>Availability |
| 586 | Service<br>Availability<br>Validation | Service Availability Validation<br>function validates that the service<br>or services specified on the<br>service order are available at the<br>specified customer/service<br>location and feasible from a<br>network point of view. | Service<br>Order<br>Management | Service<br>Availability |
| 571 | Service<br>Delivery<br>Due Date<br>Calculation | Service Delivery Due Date<br>Calculation functions calculates<br>the service delivery due date<br>using network capacity, access<br>provider selection and work center<br>intelligence (including workload<br>and capacity). | Service<br>Order<br>Management | Service<br>Order<br>Initialization |

# 3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate are listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event.

## 3.1. Exposed APIs

The following diagram illustrates API/Resource/Operation:
