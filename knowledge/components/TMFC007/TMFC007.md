# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Functional Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service Order<br>Management | TMFC007 | Service Order Management (SOM)<br>component is the entry point to the<br>Production Domain. It oversees delivery of<br>Customer-Facing-Service (CFS) resources<br>(network and service platform equipment).<br>The SOM exposes the API ServiceOrder. It is<br>triggered when the Product Order Delivery<br>Orchestration And Management<br>component calls this API to request CFS<br>delivery. To achieve delivery of a CFS, the<br>SOM orchestrates the CFS delivery process<br>which identifies possible RFS and chooses<br>one, using the catalog and technical<br>inventory. It selects the resources (servers,<br>equipment, etc.) and their instances, and<br>requests the Resource Order Management<br>(ROM) component to update selected<br>resource instances to deliver CFS.<br>Requests sent to the ROM contain the CFS<br>and the list of configured resource<br>instances to be updated. | Production |

| 598 | Service Order<br>Orchestration | The Service Order Orchestration<br>function provides workflow and<br>orchestration capabilities for a<br>dedicated Service (CFS) Order.<br>Orchestration is needed when:<br>• the technical solution<br>includes the expansion of<br>the operator Installed<br>Resources or the purchase<br>of a partner product (ex:<br>local loop purchase)<br>• a work order is necessary<br>at the delivery address or<br>somewhere in the operator<br>network<br>• part of the delivery process<br>or checks needs to be<br>delegated to another<br>Service Order Manager<br>• contributing or support<br>systems must be informed<br>Example: to deliver a VOIP<br>service, it will orchestrate<br>actions on Access Network<br>Factory, VOIP service platform<br>and CPE.<br>Service Order Orchestration will<br>also orchestrate and manage<br>dependencies between related<br>Service Order items of Service<br>Order. | Service Order<br>Management | Service Order<br>Orchestration |
| 734 | Service Data<br>Collection | The Service Data Collection<br>function gathers any needed<br>service data to aid in the<br>verification and issuance of a<br>complete and valid service order<br>as well as data necessary to<br>address dependencies between<br>service and/or resource orders. | Service Order<br>Management | Service Order<br>Orchestration |
| 963 | Service Task<br>Item<br>Decompositio<br>n | Service Task Item<br>Decomposition: By a request for<br>an orchestration of a service the<br>service needs to be analyzed<br>and decomposed into the part-<br>actions necessary to take to<br>fulfill the requested<br>orchestration. The Service may<br>consist of several services and<br>may use a number of<br>Resources. It may also be<br>controlled by several<br>parameters for optional<br>behaviors. This composition of<br>the Service is given by<br>configuration data available<br>from Catalog applications and<br>the Service Capability<br>Orchestration application. | Service Order<br>Management | Service Order<br>Orchestration |
| 968 | Service Work<br>Item<br>Sequence<br>Execution | Service Work Item Sequence<br>Execution function executes<br>each individual item in<br>sequence of the service<br>orchestration to fulfill, or roll<br>back according to a pre-defined<br>configuration, and reports the<br>sequence execution result.<br>Because of the “Service<br>Decomposition” of an<br>orchestration request the result<br>may be several actions that<br>needs to take place in a specific<br>sequence. | Service Order<br>Management | Service Order<br>Orchestration |
| 969 | Service Work<br>Item<br>Sequence<br>Execution<br>Configuration | The “Service Work Item<br>Sequence Execution" function<br>controls so that the sequence is<br>fulfilled or rolled back. The rules<br>for the sequence execution will<br>set the conditions for the<br>fulfillment, or roll-back, and for<br>the reporting and notification.<br>The “Service Task Item<br>Sequence Carry Through<br>configuration" is a management<br>of the application function that<br>defines how the execution of the<br>orchestration sequence will be<br>done. | Service Order<br>Management | Service Order<br>Orchestration |

| 1141 | Installed<br>Resources<br>Identification | Installed Resources<br>Identification Function identifies<br>the installed resources to<br>update, as part of the chosen<br>technical solution, to deliver the<br>ordered service (CFS).<br>This information enriches the<br>CFS order and the CFS.<br>This choice is based on service<br>catalogue rules (between RFS<br>specification and Resources<br>specification) and it can be<br>necessary to check the installed<br>resources availability,<br>occupancy, etc. via the<br>Resource Availability function.<br>Cloud example: In case of a<br>cloud service, the Service Order<br>Delivery process only identifies<br>the equipment in charge of the<br>management of the cloud<br>infrastructure and it will be<br>informed of the ordered service<br>characteristics. Depending on<br>its own rules, the cloud<br>infrastructure manager will<br>decide or not to immediately<br>allocate and configure all or part<br>of the required resources.<br>So the first usage request of the<br>cloud service can trigger the<br>effective choice and<br>configuration of the necessary<br>resources and these resources<br>can change between usages. In<br>this case the end of the delivery<br>process is assumed by the<br>manager of the cloud<br>infrastructure.<br>Note: This function is globally a<br>part of the technical solution<br>identification. | Service Order<br>Management | Installed<br>Resources<br>Identification |
| 733 | Service Order<br>Decompositio<br>n | The Service Order<br>Decomposition Function allows<br>in the context of a Service Order<br>to prepare Resource Order,<br>Service Order which will be<br>delegated to another system,<br>Supplier Order, Stock Item<br>Order or Work Order with the<br>necessary information (the<br>effective update in the order<br>repositories will be supported by<br>the corresponding Order<br>Repository Management<br>functions).<br>In the case of a Service<br>associated with an existing<br>Internal Resource Type, this<br>function also allows to:<br>• check if a corresponding<br>Installed Resource is<br>operational in the resource<br>installed base, and determine<br>the operation to be performed at<br>Resource level (creation or<br>modification)<br>• eventually group in the same<br>Resource order several ordered<br>services, based on the same<br>Customer Facing Service<br>Specification (a.k.a. CFS<br>specification), and/or identified<br>to be delivered at the same time<br>by the Service Order Delivery<br>Orchestration. | Service Order<br>Management | Service Order<br>Delivery<br>Preparation |

# 3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event. <Note note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In addition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>

## 3.3. Events

The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from the APIs listed in the preceding sections.

![](media/events-structure.png)
*([PlantUML source](media/events-structure.puml))*

Event name always follows same pattern: <<Resource>> + <<Type of Event>> + "Event" The type of event could be: • Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). • Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. • AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • StateChange: resource state has changed.
