# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bill<br>Calculation | TMFC031 | The Bill Calculation processes all<br>charges against billing accounts during<br>bill cycles. Bill Calculation can be<br>executed both on a cyclic basis and on<br>demand. It performs calculations with bill<br>compilation of charges, credits, fees &<br>taxes, including pro rata, at various<br>levels, such as product and/or account<br>level that have been generated since the<br>last run for that account, applying<br>promotions and discounts as well. | Core<br>Commerce<br>Management |
