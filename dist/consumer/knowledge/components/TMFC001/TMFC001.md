# 2. eTOM Processes, SID Data

Entities and Functional Framework Functions

## 2.1. eTOM business activities

eTOM business activities this ODA Component is responsible for:

| Identifier | Level | Business Activity Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2.7 | L2 | Product<br>Specification &<br>Offering<br>Development &<br>Retirement | Product Specification & Offering Development<br>& Retirement processes develop and deliver<br>new product specifications as well as<br>enhancements and new features, ready for<br>use by other processes. Additionally, they<br>handle the removal of specifications no<br>longer offered.<br>Product specifications represent the types of<br>services and resources made available as<br>product offerings to the market by an<br>enterprise. The key measures of this process<br>are how effectively the enterprise’s offerings<br>are broadened by these specifications or new<br>specification features. These processes also<br>manage updates and enhancements to<br>product specifications. Business case<br>development tracking and commitment are<br>key elements of this process.<br>They also develop new product offerings and<br>their associated features. Pricing for the<br>offerings is also developed, such as standard<br>pricing and feature-based pricing. The<br>offerings and selected processes are included<br>in product catalogs which are also developed<br>by these processes. |
| 1.2.19 | L2 | Product Catalog<br>Planning<br>Management | Product Catalog Planning Management<br>business process covers a set of business<br>activities that understand and enable<br>establish the plan to define, design and<br>operationalize a catalog in order to meet the<br>needs and objectives of Product cataloging.<br>The Product Catalog Planning Management<br>business process ensure that the organization<br>is able to identify the most appropriate<br>scheme and goal for it catalog. It includes<br>designing the Catalog plan and developing the<br>specification according to Product<br>management requirement. |
| 1.2.20 | L2 | Product Catalog<br>Lifecycle<br>Management | Catalog Lifecycle Management business<br>process covers a set of business activities<br>that enable us to manage the lifecycle of an<br>organizations catalog from design to build<br>according to defined requirements. |

| 1.6.4 | L2 | Business Partner<br>Offering<br>Development &<br>Retirement | Business Partner Offering Development &<br>Retirement supports the management of on-<br>boarding and off-boarding another Business<br>Partner's product specifications and product<br>offerings that a required to facilitate the<br>business model of the enterprise.<br>It also manages the involvement the<br>enterprise has with a product specification<br>and product offering. For example, the<br>enterprise may accept an order for one of its<br>offerings, but it may be fulfilled by another<br>Business Partner.<br>Note:<br>- Product Specification Development &<br>Retirement and Product Offering<br>Development & Retirement processes are<br>used to manage most of the lifecycle of<br>product specifications and product offerings.<br>This is done to eliminate redundant<br>processes. For example, the Product Offering<br>Pricing processes are used to manage the<br>prices associated with on-boarded product<br>offerings.<br>- This process therefore focuses on managing<br>the relationship that parties, including the<br>enterprise, have with product specifications<br>and product offerings as well as the impact of<br>off-boarding specifications and offerings on a<br>provider's service and resource infrastructure. |
