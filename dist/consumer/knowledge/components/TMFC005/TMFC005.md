# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product<br>Inventory | TMFC005 | The Product Inventory component is<br>responsible for storage and exposure of<br>products that are assigned to and used by<br>Parties. This component has functionality<br>that enables creation of inventory items,<br>inventory organization, inventory search or<br>filter, inventory monitoring and tracking,<br>inventory control and inventory auditing. The<br>minimum check to be performed upon<br>inventory item creation or update is for global<br>consistency with related Product Catalog<br>information. | Core<br>Commerce<br>Management |
