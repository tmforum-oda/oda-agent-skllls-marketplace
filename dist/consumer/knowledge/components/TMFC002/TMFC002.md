# 1. Overview

| Component Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product Order<br>Capture and<br>Validation | TMFC002 | This component captures what a customer<br>wants to order based on the CSP's Product<br>Catalog. It enables configuration of the<br>product offerings and products desired,<br>provides quotes, checks the eligibility of the<br>customer order, and completes it with<br>information needed such as the related<br>parties or associated billing account and the<br>delivery appointment. This component owns<br>quote management, order capture and<br>validation, using dedicated components (eg<br>Offering Configurator, Service Qualification,<br>Party Management) when needed. After the<br>delivery of the customer product order items,<br>this component is also in charge of the<br>commercial closure of the order. It includes<br>update of the Product Inventory (status and<br>starting/end date of tariffs and discounts) and<br>potential commercial rules control (eg receipt<br>of the contract document signed by the<br>customer). | Core Commerce |

## 3.3. Events

The diagram illustrates the Events which the component publishes and the Events that the component subscribes to and then receives. Both lists are derived from the APIs listed in the preceding sections. The type of event could be: • Create: a new resource has been created (following a POST). • Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. • AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • StateChange: resource state has changed.
