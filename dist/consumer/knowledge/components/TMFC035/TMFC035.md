# 3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event.

## 3.1. Exposed APIs

Following diagram illustrates API/Resource/Operation:

| API ID | API Name | API Version | Mandatory / Optional | Operations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TMF672 | User Role<br>Permission<br>Management | 4 | Mandatory | GET Permission<br>(Permission,<br>UserRole)<br>GET/id Permission<br>POST Permission<br>PATCH Permission<br>DELETE Permission<br>GET UserRole<br>GET/id UserRole<br>POST UserRole<br>PATCH UserRole<br>DELETE UserRole |
| TMF669 | Party Role<br>Management | 4 | Mandatory | GET partyRole<br>GET/id partyRole<br>POST partyRole<br>PATCH partyRole<br>DELETE partyRole |
| TMF701 | Process Flow | 4 | Optional | n/a |

## 3.2. Dependent APIs

Following diagram illustrates API/Resource/Operation potentially used by the product catalog component:

| API ID | API Name | API Version | Mandatory / Optional | Operations | Rationales |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TMF632 | Party<br>Management | 4 | Mandatory | GET<br>induvidual /<br>organization<br>GET/ID<br>induvidual /<br>organization | All roles and<br>identities need<br>to be accosiated<br>with a valid and<br>current Party<br>data object. |
| TMF701 | Process Flow | 4 | Optional | na |   |

## 3.3. Events

The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from the APIs listed in the preceding sections.
