2. eTOM Processes, SID Data Entities and Functional Framework Functions

## 2.1. eTOM business activities

eTOM business activities this ODA Component is responsible for.

| Identifier | Level | Business<br>Activity<br>Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.9.4 | L2 | Cross/Up Sell | Cross/Up Sell ensures that the value of the relationship between the customer or other party and an enterprise is maximized by selling<br>additional, or more of the existing, product offerings. The ongoing analysis of customer or other party trends, such as usage, problems,<br>complaints, is used to identify when the current offerings may no longer be appropriate or when the opportunity for a larger sale arises. Based<br>on the data collected, more appropriate or other offering(s) may be recommended to the customer or other party. |
| 1.1.9.4.2 | L3 | Recommend<br>Appropriate<br>Product<br>Offering(s) | Recommend Appropriate Product Offering(s) recommends more appropriate or other product offering(s) to the customer or other party that<br>may be based on the results of Analyze Customer or Other Party Trends or based on known other offerings that represent an upsell.<br>For example, a potential new partner may be offered the opportunity to have there logo and contact information added to an enterprise's<br>application that manages a IoT device. |

## 2.2. SID ABEs

SID ABEs this ODA Component is responsible for:

*: if SID ABE Level 2 is not specified this means that all the L2 business entities must be implemented, else the L2 SID ABE Level is specified. Note: There is need to create Product Recommendation Management BE in SID.

## 2.3. eTOM L2 - SID ABEs links

eTOM L2 vS SID ABEs links for this ODA Component.

## 2.4. Functional Framework Functions

| Function<br>ID | Function<br>Name | Function Description | Aggregate<br>Function<br>Level 1 | Aggregate<br>Function<br>Level 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1196 | Product<br>Specification &<br>Offering<br>Simulation | Product Specification & Offering Simulation Function simulates Product Specification configuration and Product<br>Offerings on the real traffic of the customer thanks to Tariff Calculation and Rating. | Product<br>Operational<br>Analysis | Pushed Offer<br>Management |
| 1195 | Pushed Offer<br>Identification | Pushed Offer Identification Function identifies offers adapted to the customer needs including personalized offers.<br>Based on a customer's individualized knowledge (Marketing one to one), the aim is to elaborate for each customer<br>according to his needs and recent action individualized Product Specifications & Offerings. | Product<br>Operational<br>Analysis | Pushed Offer<br>Management |

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event. <Note note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In addition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>
