# 3. TMF OPEN APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 4: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event. <Note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In addition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>

## 3.1. Exposed APIs

Following diagram illustrates API/Resource/Operation:

## 3.3. Events

The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from the APIs listed in the preceding sections.

![](media/events-structure.png)
*([PlantUML source](media/events-structure.puml))*

The type of event could be: • Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). • Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. • AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. • StateChange: resource state has changed.
