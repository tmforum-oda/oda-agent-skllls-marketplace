# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service<br>Inventory | TMFC008 | The Service Inventory component is responsible<br>for storage and exposure of CFS (Customer Facing<br>Services) that are associated to Product Inventory<br>items. It is also responsible for RFS (Resource<br>Facing Service) definition, mapping between CFS<br>and RFS and mapping with infrastructure/network<br>resources. The Service Inventory component has<br>functionality that enables creation of inventory<br>items, inventory organization, inventory search or<br>filter, inventory monitoring and tracking, inventory<br>control and inventory auditing. The minimum<br>check to be performed at inventory item creation<br>or update is for global consistency with related<br>Service Catalog information. | Production |

# 3. TMF OPEN APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate are listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event.

## 3.1. Exposed APIs

The following diagram illustrates API/Resource/Operation:
