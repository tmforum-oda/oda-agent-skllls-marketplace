# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Party<br>Interaction<br>Management | TMFC023 | Party Interaction deals with the initial greeting and<br>welcoming of a new contact. This will typically be<br>the first component in a customer experience<br>journey, shared by unassisted (self-service, retail<br>kiosk) or assisted (call center, retail store) channels.<br>It will identify known Parties or new Parties and react<br>appropriately to propose available actions.

# 3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: • List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. • List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. • List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event.

## 3.1. Exposed APIs
