# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resource<br>Inventory | TMFC012 | The Resource Inventory component owns<br>accounting for resources (all inputs - including<br>stock, parts, assets, production components etc.)<br>that are owned and/or held for allocation and/or<br>use by the organization. The Resource Inventory<br>component has functionality that includes<br>inventory item creation, inventory organization,<br>inventory search or filter, inventory monitoring and<br>tracking, inventory control (organization, re-stock<br>management etc.) and inventory auditing. The<br>minimum check to be performed at inventory item<br>creation or update is for global consistency with<br>related Resource Catalog information. | Production |
