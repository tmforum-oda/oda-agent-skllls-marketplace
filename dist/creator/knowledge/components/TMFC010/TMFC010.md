# 1. Overview

| Component<br>Name | ID | Description | ODA Function Block |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resource<br>Catalog<br>Management | TMFC010 | The Resource Catalog Management component is<br>responsible for organizing the collection of resource<br>specifications that identify and define all<br>requirements for a resource. The Resource Catalog<br>Management component has the functionality that<br>enables presentation of a customer-facing view, so<br>users are able to browse and select resources they<br>need, as well as a technical view to enable definition<br>and setup of resources contained in the resource<br>catalog. Additional functionalities include capturing<br>new resource specifications, managing resources<br>(registering assets and components and identifying<br>and mapping connections / relationships),<br>administering the lifecycle of resources, describing<br>relationships between resources, reporting on<br>resources and changes to their attributes, and<br>facilitating easy access to identify and assign<br>resources. | Production |

These<br>processes develop and document the required<br>resource features, the specific technology<br>requirements and selections, the specific<br>operational, performance and quality requirements<br>and support activities, any resource specific data<br>required for the systems and network infrastructure.<br>The Develop Detailed Resource Specifications<br>processes provide input to these specifications. The<br>processes ensure that all detailed specifications are<br>produced and appropriately documented.<br>Additionally, the processes ensure that the<br>documentation is captured in an appropriate<br>enterprise repository. |

## 2.2. SID ABEs

SID ABEs this ODA Component is responsible for:

| SID ABE Level 1 | SID ABE Level 2 (or set of BEs)* |
| --- | --- |
| Resource Specification ABE |   |
| Resource Performance ABE | Resource Performance Specification BE |
| Resource Usage ABE | ResourceUsageSpec BE |
| Resource Configuration ABE | ResourceConfigSpec BE |

*: if SID ABE Level 2 is not specified this means that all the L2 business entities must be implemented, else the L2 SID ABE Level is specified.
