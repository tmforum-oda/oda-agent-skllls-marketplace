"""Reads: skills/**, knowledge/**.
Writes: dist/consumer/** and dist/creator/** (each a self-contained Claude
Code plugin: skills/ subset with knowledge/ path references rewritten to
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/..., a full verbatim copy of knowledge/, and
.claude-plugin/plugin.json).
Track: n/a -- packaging step, not part of either refresh track. Run after
any change to skills/ or knowledge/ to regenerate both distributable plugin
bundles in dist/.

tools/build_plugin.py -- package skills/ + knowledge/ as two separate
Claude Code plugins in dist/consumer/ and dist/creator/, published through
the oda-agent-skills-marketplace repo. The user explicitly chose to bundle
knowledge/ inside each plugin, accepting that it breaks the norm that
plugins should be small/fast (and that knowledge/ is duplicated a third
time, once per plugin, on top of the repo's own top-level copy), so each
plugin has zero dependency on any project-specific clone or directory
layout.

Two plugins, not one, because the skill set has two distinct audiences that
rarely overlap in a single install: consumers building a product using ODA
don't want the drafting/correction skills cluttering their skill list, and
vice versa for people extending ODA itself. Splitting them keeps each
plugin's skill list focused on what that audience actually invokes.

The one non-mechanical step this script exists to do: skills/*/SKILL.md
are authored with plain relative paths (knowledge/use-cases/...) so they
work unmodified for a direct clone, where the agent's cwd contains
knowledge/ as a sibling. A plugin installs to
~/.claude/plugins/cache/... instead -- NOT the user's project cwd -- so a
bare relative path would silently resolve against the wrong directory
there. Claude Code substitutes ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to the plugin's real
install directory, but ONLY inside plugin skills, so baking that syntax
into the canonical skills/*/SKILL.md would make it inert (literal,
unsubstituted text) for the direct-clone case. Resolved by
keeping one canonical source (plain paths) and mechanically rewriting
`knowledge/` -> `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/` only in the copies
under dist/, the same "generate the packaged form, never hand-maintain
two versions" pattern this repo already uses for knowledge/ itself
(generated from references/).

Must be idempotent (spec.md principle 7): dist/ is deleted and rebuilt
from scratch every run, so two consecutive runs with no source changes
produce an identical file set and identical file content.

Every skill directory under skills/ must appear in exactly one of
CONSUMER_SKILLS, CREATOR_SKILLS, or INTERNAL_ONLY_SKILLS below -- main()
fails loudly if a skill is unclassified (new skill added, not sorted into
a bucket yet) or double-classified, rather than silently dropping it from
both plugins or shipping it in both.
