"""Reads: references/components/{ID}/{ID}_{Name}_v{version}.pdf.
Writes: knowledge/components/{ID}/{ID}.md, knowledge/components/{ID}/media/*.
Track: automated (spec/spec-components.md 7) -- no login gate, but heavier
than fetch_component.py's tag-pinned discovery: the download URL has to be
resolved from a real TM Forum ODA directory page load per component first
(spec/spec-components.md 3), not assembled from a URL pattern. That
discovery+download step isn't done by this script, and as of
spec/tasks-components.md Phase 8 isn't yet its own checked-in tools/*.py
script either -- done per-component via a driven browser through Phases
1-6. This script only does the PDF -> Markdown half, once a URL and the
raw PDF are already in hand.

tools/pdf2md_component.py -- TM Forum Component Specification PDF ->
knowledge/components/<ID>/<ID>.md

Strips the fixed set of boilerplate sections documented in
spec/spec-components.md 4.1 (title page, Notice, Table of Contents,
References, Administrative Appendix and its children) using the same
mechanical, heading-name-driven approach as tools/docx2md.py (spec/spec.md
5.1.1) -- adapted for numbered PDF section headings ("2.3. Functional
Framework Functions") instead of Word paragraph styles, since these PDFs
carry no style/outline metadata pypdf or pdfplumber can read directly.

Tables are real GFM tables, not verbatim text. Per page: pdfplumber's
`find_tables()` gives each table's bounding box and cell grid directly (it
does its own line/rect-based structural detection -- this is not a text-
layout heuristic), and `page.filter()` then extracts the *prose* text with
every table's own bounding box excluded, so table content is never counted
twice. A table that continues onto the next page (TM Forum's own template
repeats the header row on each new page) is detected by comparing the new
page's first table's normalized header against the still-open table's, and
merged into one continuous table rather than emitted as several small ones.

Images are linked inline from the body, at the position they actually
appear (interleaved with prose and tables the same way, by vertical
position on the page -- not appended as a files-extracted-but-unlinked
footnote). Deduplicated by content hash before being saved -- every page
of these PDFs repeats the same TM Forum logo image, which would otherwise
flood media/ with dozens of copies of the same three logo bitmaps (see
spec/spec-components.md 4.2). Position comes from `pdfplumber` (`page.
images`, which gives each image's bounding box); the actual decoded bytes
come from `pypdf` (`page.images[i].data`, already a valid PNG/JPEG) rather
than from `pdfplumber` itself, since pdfplumber's image objects are a raw,
still-encoded content stream. The two libraries report a page's images in
the same order, confirmed directly against this component's real PDF, so
matching them up by index within a page is reliable.

Usage:
    python pdf2md_component.py <ID> <name> <version> <pdf_url> <src.pdf> <out.md> <media_dir_name> [status]

    <status> is the component's directory status (spec/spec-components.md 6)
    -- defaults to "specified" since that's true for most of the 25
    components with a PDF at all, but TMFC011 is "Pre-production", not
    "specified", and the envelope must say so rather than defaulting.

Example:
    python pdf2md_component.py TMFC039 "Agreement Management" 1.1.0 \
        https://oda-production.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1.0.0/TMFC039_Agreement_Management_v1.1.0.pdf \

    """(header_tuple, data_rows, leading_leftover) from a pdfplumber extract_tables()
    grid. `leading_leftover` is None, or a single row (already through the same
    column corrections as data_rows) that the caller should append onto the
    still-open table's own last row rather than treat as a new row of this table --
    see the comment where it's produced, below.

    Leading rows whose first cell is empty are header continuation fragments
    (a merged/split header cell rendered as extra rows, e.g. "Mandatory /"
    on one row and "Optional" directly below it in the same column) -- they
    get merged column-wise into a single header row rather than kept as
    blank-looking data rows.

    A header cell that needed this row-merge (i.e. its text is taller/wraps
    across the header's own multiple grid rows) throws off pdfplumber's
    column-boundary detection for the *data* rows beneath it: the data that
    actually belongs under that header lands one column to the left instead
    (confirmed on TMFC039's SID ABEs and Overview tables, and its Exposed/
    Dependent APIs tables -- every column whose header needed a row-merge
    has this exact one-column-left data shift; every column whose header
    didn't need one is already correctly aligned). Fixed by recording which
    column indices received a merge, then shifting that data back right
    before reading it as real content -- rather than a blanket "any
    blank-header column merges into its neighbour" rule, which would also
    fire on ordinary spacer columns that are never populated in the first
    place and don't need touching.

    Columns that are empty across the *entire* table (header and every data
    row, after the shift above) are merged-cell artifacts, not real
    columns, and are dropped.

    A table that continues onto a new page can have a leftover, still-
    wrapping line from the *previous* page's last data row appear as its
    own row at the very top of this page's grid, with an empty first cell
    just like a real header-continuation row (confirmed on the Functional
    Framework Functions table's page 2: `['', '', 'or group of products of
    the partner.', '', None, ...]`, the tail end of a Description cell that
    didn't fit on page 1). Treated as a real continuation, this both
    corrupts the header text (already handled by the caller always keeping
    the first clean header seen) and -- the bug this guard actually fixes
    -- wrongly marks that column as "shifted", so a *later* legitimate data
    row's Function Name then gets merged into Function Description instead
    of staying in its own column. Distinguished from a real continuation
    fragment ("Function", "Level 1", "(or set of BEs)") by shape: every
    genuine one seen across this whole document is a short label with no
    sentence-ending punctuation or comma; a leftover wrapped sentence or
    operation-list fragment is neither -- the comma check specifically was
    added after a second, shorter leftover fragment slipped past the length
    check alone (`TMFC002`'s Dependent APIs table: a lone `"Patch,\nDelete"`
    -- the tail of a wrapped Operations cell -- read as short and
    period-free, and wrongly flagged the *Operation* column as shifted,
    which then ate every subsequent row's *Resource* column value).

    Text shape alone still isn't enough -- a *third* leftover fragment
    (`TMFC005`'s Exposed APIs table: a lone `"hub"` / `"POST\nDELETE"` pair,
    the tail of a wrapped Resource/Operations row) is short and free of
    both period and comma, so it also passes the shape check. The check
    that actually catches this one is structural, not textual: every
    genuine multi-row header continuation seen in this whole document
    re-extends the *same* set of column positions on every continuation
    row (e.g. the Functional Framework Functions header's "Aggregate" /
    "Function" / "Level 1" continuation touches columns {4, 7} on both of
    its continuation rows) -- a leftover data row instead touches a
    *different* set of columns unrelated to whichever header cell was
    actually still incomplete (`hub`/`POST DELETE` touches the Resource/
    Operations columns, which round out fine from row 0 alone and were
    never part of any continuation). The first continuation row accepted
    establishes that column set; every later candidate row must match it
    exactly or the continuation loop stops there.
